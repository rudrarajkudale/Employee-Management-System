## Overview
This is an Employee Management System (EMS) built using React, Tailwind CSS, and localStorage. The application allows users to manage employees, assign tasks, track employee activity, and more, with a modern and responsive user interface.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Employees can have tasks assigned to them, which can be marked as active or completed.
- **Employee List**: View the details of all employees including their task count and active status.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes to the employee tasks or data are reflected in real-time, thanks to local state and localStorage persistence.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Authentication**: The system uses a context-based authentication to manage user data and interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- **localStorage**: A web storage solution used to persist employee data across sessions.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For core application logic.

## Usage

### Manage Employees
- **View Employees**: Employees can be viewed in a list, where you can see their task status and other related details.
- **Assign Tasks**: Tasks can be assigned to employees and their status can be updated from "New" to "Active".
- **Accepting Tasks**: Employees can accept tasks from the task list, and their task count will be updated accordingly.

### LocalStorage Integration
The app stores data in **localStorage**, ensuring that user data persists even when the page is reloaded or closed. If no data is found in **localStorage**, default values will be initialized.

## Key Components
- **AuthContext**: Manages the global state related to employees and tasks. It uses **React Context API** to provide data throughout the app.
- **TaskCard**: Displays individual tasks and allows users to accept or reject tasks.
- **EmployeeList**: Lists all employees with their active task counts and task details.
- **EmployeePage**: Detailed page for each employee, showing their tasks and status.
